      Richard hails from Tulsa. He has earned degrees from the University of Oklahoma and Stanford. (Go Sooners and
      Cardinals!)
      Before starting Pied Piper, he worked for Hooli as a part time software developer.
      While his work focuses on applied information theory,
      mostly optimizing lossless compression schema of both the length-limited and adaptive variants,
      his non-work interests range widely, everything from quantum computing to chaos theory.
      He could tell you about it, but THAT would NOT be a “length-limited” conversation!

        Pied Piper is a multi-platform technology based on a proprietary universal compression algorithm that has
        consistently fielded high Weisman Scores™ that are not merely competitive,
        but approach the theoretical limit of lossless compression.
